## 📌 Business Context

Royal Horizon Hotels Pvt. Ltd. is a growing mid-to-premium chain with multiple properties across urban and leisure locations. While the brand maintains healthy occupancy, recent reviews and satisfaction metrics have shown inconsistency across different properties and guest segments.

In response, the leadership team has initiated a data-driven project to evaluate every touchpoint in the guest journey—from pre-booking behavior to post-stay feedback—to drive strategic improvements in guest experience, loyalty, and brand reputation.
